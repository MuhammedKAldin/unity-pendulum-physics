pendulum physics and verlet velocity in action.

1.Example-1 : Simple overview of the pendulum physics

Check list :
- Parenting target and handling physics correctly
- Swinging physics
- Momentum based on verlet velocity
- Constraint length adaption to distance from pivot point
- Air ressistance in opposite direction
- Cap speed limit, preventing Flash <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.r95UKzZ1V2kK5RDZsXIbCwHaHS?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" width="40px"> Speed from happening eventually.
- Dynamicly change pivot point to move according to it (Lesson 3)
